# toy_terraform_flask_deployment

A simple POC for working with AWS via Terraform.  Currently this will only work with a flask application running within docker, but further changes will make this more modular.

## Requirements
- AWS account 
- An IAM profile in the account with the necessary permissions
- Terraform
- A github repo to use as your target repository
- oauth token created on github with access to your target repository

## Installation
TODO

## Use
TODO

## DISCLAIMER
- some of the deployed resources will incur charges to your AWS account if you do not destroy your resources when finished.  I take no responsibility for charges incurred.
